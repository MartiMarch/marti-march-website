      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have worked with various cloud providers, such as GCP, IBM and Azure. Yes, they are some of the most used, but I lack experience with the most popular one: AWS. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve used it superficially, I wanted to practice with some of the available&#xA;services, although I no longer have any free credits left in my account&amp;hellip; I began researching until I came across LocalStack, a project that emulates various AWS services in a container. So, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I&amp;rsquo;ll cover in this post: how&#xA;I set up a small environment using different AWS services through LocalStack, Terraform and Python.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
