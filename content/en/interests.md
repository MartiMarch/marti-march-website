My professional experience began with a simple question: how is it possible to keep a computer running without downtime? That initial curiosity led me to join the DevOps world. I learned the fundamentals of the software lifecycle and infrastructure.
Over time, my role evolved, and I worked as a DevOps Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, and Platform Engineer.

I enjoy programming, so I often solve problems by combining infrastructure and CI/CD with backend development principles. I'm currently learning about Kubernetes Operators, event-driven architecture and distributed systems to level up my skills and be 
able to build flexible solutions at massive scale.

Beyond my professional experience, I have independently built a pre-production environment. It consists of a Kubernetes cluster with several tools from the cloud-native ecosystem. This project has allowed me to apply concepts such as  Infrastructure as 
Code (IaC), observability, security, and automation in a controlled environment.

I'm especially interested in topics such as:
- Distributed Systems
- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
- Kubernetes Operators
- Backend development
- CI/CD
- Platform Engineer
- Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
